Monitoring program for the IP running on the ARM core.
This whole code has to be embedded into a Xilinx ZedBoard software project.
If you are using another board from Xilinx, you will have to change relevant
files.  
This has to be compiled under the Xilinx SDK.  
Check in `main.c` exemples to use the neural network API with MNIST data or
user custom data.
